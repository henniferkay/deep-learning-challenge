# deep-learning-challenge

## Background

This project explores fictional data on venture success of organizations that have applied for funding by an investment company called Alphabet Soup. Our goal was to develop a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful in their ventures if funded by Alphabet Soup.

We were provided with a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The dataset contained the following information:

* EIN and NAME—-identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—-funding application type
* AFFILIATION—-affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—-government organization classification
* USE_CASE—-use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—-organization type
* STATUS—-active status
* INCOME_AMT--income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS--special considerations for application
* ASK_AMT—-funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL--whether the money used effectively

## Methods



## Results

### Data Preprocessing
```
* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

* What variable(s) are the features for your model?

* What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

```

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
```
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
```

## Conclusion and Future Directions
Describe how you could use a different model to solve the same problem, and explain why you would use that model
